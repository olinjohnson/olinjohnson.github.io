      <description>A conceptual overview of the theory behind neural networks</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of work learning about AI and neural networksâ€“specifically by creating deep learning models from scratch. So, I thought I&rsquo;d document some of that learning in a multi-part series about deep learning.</p>
<p>In case you&rsquo;re not already familiar, neural networks are AI processes that are modeled after the human brain and can solve problems by simulating human methods of learning.</p>
<p>For example, in the same way that your brain has learned to differentiate between cats and dogs, we can also teach a neural network to classify types of pets (among other things).</p>

<p>Well, let&rsquo;s first look at one of the most essential building blocks of the human brain:</p>

<p>As you can see, this is a model of a neuron. For our purposes, we&rsquo;ll mostly focus on the dendrites and axons of the neuron.</p>
<p>In your brain, neurons link together to form neuron chains, which propagate chemical signals from neuron to neuron. These chemical signals are what ultimately determine whether or not certain neurons fire.</p>
<p>In order to form these chains, the dendrites of one neuron connect to the axons of another (via axon terminals) over a space called a synapse. By connecting these ends, you can see how neurons can be strung together to form really long chain chains.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like plugging extension cords into each other:</p>

</p>
<p>Using the extension cord example, it&rsquo;s easy to see how a lot of neurons could be connected together (billions of &rsquo;em) and how they can fire in succession based on chemical signals that travel through the neuron chains.</p>
<h3 id="ok-so">Ok, so?</h3>
<p>In essence, a neural network tries to simulate these complex chains of neurons to make decisions like a human would.</p>
<p>Computationally speaking, we can do this by representing neurons using code, and then simulating how neuron chains would fire to make a decision or judgment like a human brain.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just a brief overview of the philosophy behind neural networks and it barely even scratches the surface of their complexity. Look out for Part 1 where I&rsquo;ll go more in depth into the code required to create the foundation of a neural network.</p>
